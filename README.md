# Myth of Soma Browser Client

Experimental browser client for the Myth of Soma using HTML5 + JavaScript
Requires a websocket proxy on server side for this client to connect to that
runs using node - will release this separately later on when I dig it out.

## License Information:
The client code itself has been licensed under MIT though there are components of it that will have their own respective licenses. **Disclaimer**: I don't know how all these would work together so may need sorting out :)
